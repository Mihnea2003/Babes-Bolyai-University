In this variation, we introduce weights to the queens and aim to find a placement that maximizes the total weight of the queens while satisfying the constraint of non-threatening positions.\n",

        "4. *Crossover*: Perform crossover (recombination) on the selected permutations to create new offspring permutations.\n",
        "\n",

        "6. *Fitness Evaluation for the new individuals*: Evaluate the fitness of the new population.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. *Form the new population*: Select the surviving individuals based on scores, with chances direct proportional with their performance.\n",
        "\n",

Additionally, the fitness function should penalize solutions that violate the non-threatening constraint by assigning a lower fitness score to such permutations.\n",
